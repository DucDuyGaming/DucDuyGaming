### My name is DucDuyGaming (real name: Nguyễn Đức Duy)
I created this account just to help translating a discord bot (GiveawayBot) into my first language, Vietnamese, without speaking up first. Here is a fun fact about me:

- Contribute in translating some video games. Also managing the Left 4 Dead Wiki on Fandom under the name "Randompeeponinternet", sometimes contributing a lot
- Suffering at school a lot
- Like to play the same game over and over again and leaving some decent game I already bought to gather dust in the Steam library
- Like to mix "anime" and "non-anime" contents whenever given a chance
- Is a host of a personal, private worst recurring series that is related to said action, and wish to record and share footages of said action if I have a good devices and recorder. The only thing I will worry for doing that is copyright, screw that
- Prefer to play Mann vs Machine on Team Fortress 2 instead of regular gameplays
- Can speak English and Vietnamese
- A Vietnamese immigrant that currently reside in Sweden. Speak Swedish horribly though, despite living here for years. This is what I get for gaming a lot I guess
- Is still terrible at coding, for now
- Want to make game and music one day
